## üìå Overview

This is a simple Windows keylogger written in C++. It monitors keypress events using the Windows API (`GetAsyncKeyState`, `GetKeyState`, and `MapVirtualKey`) and writes the captured keystrokes to a file called `LogFile.txt`.

The compiled `.exe` file is typically flagged by Windows Defender and most antivirus programs. However, transferring the **source code** to a system and compiling it **locally** may evade AV detection.
